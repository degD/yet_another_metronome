Yet Another Metronome (YAM) is a simplistic metronome app I built as an amateur musician looking for a free, ad-free, and powerful alternative. 

Most apps I tried had a BPM (beats per minute) limit around 200, which felt too restrictive. I wanted something much faster, so I built it myself.

* Simple and clean interface
* Light and dark mode support with a quick toggle
* High BPM support (up to 600) beyond typical app limits
* High beat number support (up to 20)
* Completely free and open-source (GPLv3 License)
* Free and most importantly, no ads
